yii2-widget-rangeinput
======================

The RangeInput widget is a customized range slider control widget based on HTML5 range input. The widget enhances the default HTML range input with various features including the following:

* Specially styled for Bootstrap 3.0 with customizable caption showing the output of the control.
* Ability to prepend and append addons (very useful to show the min and max ranges, and the slider measurement unit).
* Allow the input to be changed both via the control or the text box.
* Automatically degrade to normal text input for unsupported Internet Explorer versions.
